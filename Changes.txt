New. Added zlib 'develop' branch as a submodule, made it to compile with the following changes:
The zlib repo is added as a submodule and switched to the 'develop' branch because main is several years behind it.
There is 2 projects zlibstat - compressiong and minizip - working with zip files. Had to do the following changes to the zlib projects:
1. Changed 'Platform toolset' for zlibstat and minizip from VS2015(v140) to VS2022(v143). Also had to remove Itanium platform support because VS2022 does not have a toolset for it.
2. Changed the C/C++ language to the latest.
3. Removed inffas8664.c from the zlibstat project, it looks like its functionality moved, but the vcproj did not get updated by the author.
4. Disabled warnings C5105 and C4244 for zlibstat, that makes the compilation output cleaner.
5. Changed the reference for minizip from the dynamic library to the static zlibstat. Modified linker settings to link with the static library for all targets.
6. Removed 'ReleaseWithoutAsm' from zlibstat configuration, made the regular Release config to be without using asm, this is because the asm files is missing in the 'develop' branch.
7. In minizip disabled warning C5105, C4267 and C4067.
8. In minizip removed the compilation option /Gm from the Debug build as this option is deprecated.
9. Changed minizip project type to 'Static library'.
10. Included ioapi.* and iowin32.* files into minizip project, for some reasonty it was missing it in 'develop' branch.
