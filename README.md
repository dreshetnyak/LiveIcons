The project is not yet compilable, still working on the core code.

Build requirements.
Visual Studio 2022, C++.

Notes.
To clone the project use the recursive flag:
git clone --recursive https://github.com/dreshetnyak/LiveIcons.git
That will also pull the submodules code.

If unzip.c in ZLib is updated then make sure that ZLibInternals.h is up to date.
